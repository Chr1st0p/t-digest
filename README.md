# Open JSON
This code is extracted from the Android project to allow
a clean-room implementation of the popular JSON API to be
available under a free license as a small and independent
dependency.

The original library [1] is licensed under a standard BSD
license with an additional line that requires the use of
the software only for "non-evil" purposes. Since this is
ill-defined, many downstream consumers of this software
find this license condition unacceptable.
